# sierpinski triangle

## What even is a sierpinski triangle?
A sierpinski triangle starts out with 4 points. It then starts by creating a focuspoint between the 4th point and one of the three other ones. With this, it just created a new point which it can create another focus point from. This will repeat how many times you'd like. At the end, you will see a structure called a sierpinski triangle.

## How it works
This programme uses python and some of its libraries. It uses "pygame" to create a window where the user can create points. It also uses "random" to choose from 3 vertices randomly.

## How to use
To use this programme, just open the python file in the repository. It will create a window. You can then click anywhere on the windows to create your 4 starting points. After a few seconds, it will then show you the sierpinski triangle you just created.
